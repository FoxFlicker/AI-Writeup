      <h1 id="intro">Artificial Intelligence Interaction</h1>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is a misnomer for what Large Language Models (LLMs) are doing behind the scenes‚Äîalthough, it isn‚Äôt a far-off description. LLMs such as OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Gemini use advanced methods of language processing, but the foundation of a LLM is built on a word-pairing and priority system. My focus is to give the reader a principle understanding of how these systems operate, explain nuances that may not be intuitively understood, and improve interaction between human beings and the artificial intelligence that we‚Äôre becoming so dependent on.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-llm-learns">How a Simple AI Learns to Talk (Without Understanding Anything)</h2>
      <p>
        At its core, LLMs recognize patterns. They don't understand words the way people do.
        Imagine you're creating a robot named <strong>Chatbyte</strong>. You program Chatbyte with a simple flourish and flick of your hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swish, flick. Voil√†! Chatbyte has learned how to process data. Now, it's time to teach.
        You feed four simple sentences to Chatbyte:
      </p>
      <ul class="data-list">
        <li>The dog cuts hair with scissors.</li>
        <li>The cat helps the dog cut hair.</li>
        <li>The scissors help the cat and the dog cut hair.</li>
        <li>The dog and the cat cut hair with scissors to help.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Chatbyte's job is to spit out sentences that look like they make sense. With each sentence, the robot is tallying every word.
      </p>

      <table class="data-table">
        <thead><tr><th>Word</th><th>Count</th><th>Word</th><th>Count</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>The</td><td>8</td><td>scissors</td><td>3</td></tr>
          <tr><td>dog</td><td>4</td><td>cat</td><td>3</td></tr>
          <tr><td>cut(s)</td><td>4</td><td>help(s)</td><td>3</td></tr>
          <tr><td>hair</td><td>4</td><td>to</td><td>1</td></tr>
          <tr><td>with</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <blockquote>
        Chatbyte‚Äôs response: ‚ÄúThe the the the the the the the dog dog dog dog cut cut cut cut hair hair hair hair cat cat cat scissors scissors scissors with with to.‚Äù
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Not quite there yet. Now Chatbyte tallies word pairs:
      </p>

      <table class="data-table">
        <thead><tr><th>Pair</th><th>Count</th><th>Pair</th><th>Count</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>The dog</td><td>4</td><td>with scissors</td><td>2</td></tr>
          <tr><td>dog cuts</td><td>3</td><td>The cat</td><td>3</td></tr>
          <tr><td>cuts hair</td><td>4</td><td>cat helps</td><td>1</td></tr>
          <tr><td>hair with</td><td>2</td><td>help the</td><td>2</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <blockquote>
        Chatbyte‚Äôs response: The dog cuts the dog cuts the dog cuts the cat the dog the cat with scissors the cat the cat.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This still isn‚Äôt sufficient. Chatbyte would then tally every group of three words. Then four, then five, six, seven, and so on.
        Once all the data is collected, Chatbyte compares the data using complex scripting in a common scripting language known as Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a swish and a flourish, Chatbyte can now use Python‚Äôs powerful data analysis features to process how words fit together.
        Keep in mind that Chatbyte is only knowledgeable about dogs and cats using scissors to cut hair.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you train a LLM using unfathomable amounts of sentences, the LLM has even more unimaginable amounts of data to work with.

          <p>Imagine you‚Äôre in a library. None of the books are in a language you understand. Your only way out is to construct a passphrase using patterns you've seen in other books. The AI does this every time it replies.</p>
